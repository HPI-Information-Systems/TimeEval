"""
An Evaluation Tool for Anomaly Detection Algorithms on Time Series Data.

Provides:
  1. tbd

How to use the documentation:

Documentation is available in two forms: docstrings provided with the code, and a loose standing reference guide,
available on `timeeval.readthedocs.io <timeeval.readthedocs.io>`_.

Code snippets in the docstring examples are indicated by three greater-than signs::

  >>> x = 42
  >>> x = x + 1

Use the built-in ``help`` function to view a function's or class' docstring::

  >>> from timeeval import TimeEval
  >>> help(TimeEval)
  ... # doctest: +SKIP
